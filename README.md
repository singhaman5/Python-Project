ðŸ§  Health & Obesity Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing health and obesity-related data using powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to gain insights into physical activity trends, nutrition habits, and obesity rates across different regions and demographics.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing-:
Handle missing values, rename/drop irrelevant columns, convert data types, and transform data using Pandas and NumPy.

Visualization-:
Create bar charts, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and more to visualize trends and patterns in health-related metrics.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-:
Explore correlations, summary statistics, and detect outliers to uncover meaningful insights.

Statistical Analysis-:
Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests) and distribution fitting to validate patterns and relationships.

Statistical Metrics Calculation-:
Use Pandas to calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other key stats for health indicators.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries
1)Python 3
2)Pandas
3)NumPy
4)Matplotlib

5)Seaborn

6)SciPy (for statistical tests)
